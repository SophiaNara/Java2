## General Specifications

The project contains two packages `stringlist` and `wombatdb`.

### The `stringlist` package

The `stringlist` package contains code that simulates a list for storing Strings.  
There are no specifications available for this package, only the Javadoc is available. Your task is to read and
understand the code and then write tests to ensure that it meets the goals of the supplied Javadoc.

### The `wombatdb` package

The `wombatdb` package contains code that simulates a simple database for storing information about Wombats and other
species.  
There is a detailed specification that was made available to the development team which you have access to. It is your
task to fully test the code and ensure that it meets those specifications.

### Overall Requirements

Marks will be awarded for both the quality and coverage of your tests.

#### Test Quality

1. Use of Junit directives to ensure that the test output is easily readable
2. use of Junit test directives to potentially minimise the number of tests that are required i.e.
   `parameterized, repeated`
3. Sensible use of `assertions`

### Test Coverage
You are to strive to achieve 100% coverage of all the code that has been distributed.
